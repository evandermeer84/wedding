    <h3>Reserach Project</h3>
    <!-- Put a link to the pdf here of the article that I wrote-->
    <p>An article that concludes the research I spent the summer of 2021 working on. Research centered on the effects of the Spectre and 
        Meltdown mitigations on the average user. I analyzed data collected through the Phoronix Test Suite system. Through statisical anaylsis of the 
        data collected, I determined the probabiity the mitigation had a significant effect on the performance of the computer.

    <h3>Typing Lab Created</h3>
    <p>For reasons of privacy and protected information, I can not post the code for this project, as it is the solution and grading scripts
        to a lab assignment that is currently being used by the department of computer science at the U of A. This is a simple typing game with three levels,
        written in Assembly to be run on the Risc-V simulator as it uses the memory mapped IO simulator and timer funcationality. This assignment was conceputalized
        by me, and the solution was written as a reference for future TA's. I also wrote am instructional webpage as a guide for students.
